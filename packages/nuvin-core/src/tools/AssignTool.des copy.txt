Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

The Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)
- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)
- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools)
- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools)
- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions (\"Can Claude...\", \"Does Claude...\", \"How do I...\") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can resume using the \"resume\" parameter. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)
- agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-py: Use this agent to verify that a Python Agent SDK application is properly configured, follows SDK best practices and documentation recommendations, and is ready for deployment or testing. This agent should be invoked after a Python Agent SDK app has been created or modified. (Tools: All tools)
- agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-ts: Use this agent to verify that a TypeScript Agent SDK application is properly configured, follows SDK best practices and documentation recommendations, and is ready for deployment or testing. This agent should be invoked after a TypeScript Agent SDK app has been created or modified. (Tools: All tools)
- feature-dev:code-architect: Designs feature architectures by analyzing existing codebase patterns and conventions, then providing comprehensive implementation blueprints with specific files to create/modify, component designs, data flows, and build sequences (Tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShell, BashOutput)
- feature-dev:code-explorer: Deeply analyzes existing codebase features by tracing execution paths, mapping architecture layers, understanding patterns and abstractions, and documenting dependencies to inform new development (Tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShell, BashOutput)
- feature-dev:code-reviewer: Reviews code for bugs, logic errors, security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and adherence to project conventions, using confidence-based filtering to report only high-priority issues that truly matter (Tools: Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch, KillShell, BashOutput)
- news-collector: Use this agent when the user requests current news, latest updates, breaking stories, or information about recent events. Examples:

- User: 'What's the latest news about AI developments?'
  Assistant: 'I'll use the news-collector agent to gather the latest AI news for you.'
  <Uses Agent tool to launch news-collector>

- User: 'Can you help me collect latest news on climate change?'
  Assistant: 'Let me activate the news-collector agent to find recent climate change news.'
  <Uses Agent tool to launch news-collector>

- User: 'I need to stay updated on tech industry news'
  Assistant: 'I'll deploy the news-collector agent to compile recent tech industry updates.'
  <Uses Agent tool to launch news-collector>

- User: 'What's happening in the world today?'
  Assistant: 'I'll use the news-collector agent to gather today's top news stories.'
  <Uses Agent tool to launch news-collector> (Tools: All tools)
- react-senior-dev: Use this agent when you need expert-level React development assistance, including:

<example>
Context: User needs to build a complex React component with advanced state management and styling.
user: \"I need to create a reusable data table component with sorting, filtering, and pagination. It should be fully typed with TypeScript and styled with CSS modules.\"
assistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the react-senior-dev agent to architect and implement this complex React component with proper TypeScript types and CSS styling.\"
<commentary>
This requires deep React knowledge, TypeScript expertise, and advanced CSS skills - perfect for the react-senior-dev agent.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is working on performance optimization for a React application.
user: \"My React app is re-rendering too frequently. Can you help optimize it?\"
assistant: \"I'll use the react-senior-dev agent to analyze your component structure and implement performance optimizations using React best practices.\"
<commentary>
Performance optimization requires senior-level understanding of React's rendering behavior, hooks, and memoization strategies.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User needs help with complex CSS layout issues in a React component.
user: \"I'm struggling to create a responsive grid layout that works across all breakpoints in my React component.\"
assistant: \"Let me engage the react-senior-dev agent to design and implement a robust, responsive CSS solution for your grid layout.\"
<commentary>
This requires both React component architecture knowledge and strong CSS skills for responsive design.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is implementing a new feature and needs architectural guidance.
user: \"I need to add real-time notifications to my React app. What's the best approach?\"
assistant: \"I'm going to use the react-senior-dev agent to design the architecture for real-time notifications, including state management, WebSocket integration, and UI components.\"
<commentary>
Architectural decisions require senior-level expertise in React patterns, state management, and system design.
</commentary>
</example> (Tools: All tools)
- code-reviewer: Use this agent when you need to review recently written code for quality, best practices, potential bugs, and improvements. This agent should be invoked after completing a logical chunk of code (a function, class, module, or feature) but before committing or moving to the next task. Examples:

<example>
Context: User has just written a new authentication function.
user: \"I just finished writing the login authentication function. Can you take a look?\"
assistant: \"I'll use the code-reviewer agent to analyze your authentication function for security issues, best practices, and potential improvements.\"
<Task tool invocation to code-reviewer agent>
</example>

<example>
Context: User has completed a React component.
user: \"Here's my new UserProfile component:\"
<code snippet>
assistant: \"Let me review this component using the code-reviewer agent to check for React best practices, performance considerations, and code quality.\"
<Task tool invocation to code-reviewer agent>
</example>

<example>
Context: User mentions they've finished implementing a feature.
user: \"I've finished implementing the payment processing feature.\"
assistant: \"Great! Before we move forward, let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the payment processing code for security vulnerabilities, error handling, and code quality.\"
<Task tool invocation to code-reviewer agent>
</example> (Tools: All tools)

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above


Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run - When you need their results to continue you can use TaskOutput in blocking mode to pause and wait for their results.
- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.
- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.
- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.

Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code
\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_description>

<example>
user: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent
</example>

<example>
user: \"Hello\"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"
</example>
